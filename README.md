# The Binder

A Python-based desktop application for PDF compilation with local file handling and a fun, user-friendly interface.

## ðŸŽ¨ Branding

The Binder is represented by our lovable eyeball logo, symbolizing the watchful gaze that keeps your PDFs organized and bound together. Our mascot, Bindy the Eyeball, is always here to guide you through your PDF compilation journey!

## Features

- **PDF Compilation**: Combine multiple PDF files into a single document.
- **Page Selection**: Choose specific pages from each PDF to include in the final compilation.
- **Cover Page Settings**: Add custom cover pages to your compiled PDF.
- **Table of Contents Integration**: 
  - While not explicitly implemented as a separate feature, the cover page settings and page selection functionality work together to create a pseudo table of contents.
  - Users can select specific pages from the first PDF to serve as cover pages or a table of contents.
  - These pages are then followed by the selected content pages from all PDFs.
- **Fun Naming**: Automatically generate unique, space-themed names for output files.
- **Report Saving and Loading**: Save your compilation settings as reports and load them later.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Colorful and intuitive interface for easy navigation and use.
